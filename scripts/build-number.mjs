/**
 * Local build counter for the version the card reports.
 *
 * The number rises with every local deploy build, so a reloaded dashboard shows
 * one nobody has seen before — if the console still prints the old one, the
 * browser served a cached bundle rather than the freshly deployed one. That is
 * the whole point of it; the released version stays the semver in
 * `package.json`.
 *
 * The counter is local to the working copy (`.build-number` is not committed):
 * it answers "is this the bundle I just built?", not "which build is this
 * across machines". It is therefore opt-in — only `builddeploy.sh` asks for it
 * (`STATSTABLE_BUILD_COUNTER=1`). A plain `npm run build`, and with it the
 * release workflow on GitHub, reports the bare semver.
 *
 * This is not a code generator — rollup replaces the placeholders in
 * `src/version.ts` at build time, so nothing has to be written into `src/`.
